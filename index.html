<h1 style="font-family:Helvetica">Defi24 Support</h1>
<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica">Who is this app for?</h3>
<p style="font-family:Helvetica"> Defi24 is addressed to investors who prioritize security and data privacy when following the evolution of their portfolio.This app is addressed to the users who want to take control of their portfolio without intermediaries or accounts.Defi24 is addressed for mid and long term holders of cryptocurrency.This is not an app intended for high frequency traders.
<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica">What exchanges are supported?</h3><p style="font-family:Helvetica"> The exchanges currently supported are: Coinbase, Binance, Bitmax, Kucoin, CoinEx, FTX, Gemini, Kraken, Huobi, Bitfinex, Coinlist, Gateio, Okex, Cryptocom.
<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica">How does the app work?</h3><p style="font-family:Helvetica"> Defi24 is a cold tracker. The user is able to enter the operations/investments carried out in the different exchanges, and defi24 calculates their total or partial gains / losses.During this process, the user will never be asked to specify any type of sensitive data to an intermediary.At no time will the user be asked for the credentials of their accounts in any exchanges or any type of personal information.<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica">Is it necessary to have an account?</h3><p style="font-family:Helvetica"> No, it is not necessary to have a defi24 account.Defi24 is a cold tracker, which means operations are entered manually by the user and no one other than the user has access to them.<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica">Is my data safe?</h3><p style="font-family:Helvetica"> Your data is completely safe. We have not requested any API key and we will not have compromised information about your exchange accounts.<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica">What happens if I lose my phone/device?</h3><p style="font-family:Helvetica"> In case of loss of your device and forced access to the defi24 app, the only accessible information would be your list of operations and the balance of your portfolio, but without any compromised data associated with you.By any means will a third person get access to any of your exchanges accounts or wallets through our app (defi24).<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica">I cannot find a specific cryptocurrency in the app. Can I add it manually?</h3><p style="font-family:Helvetica"> If you would like a currency to be available to add to your list of operations, you can report it in the Contact support section, indicating the reason for contact.The defi24 team will come up with the solution as soon as possible.<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica">Can I add sell operations?</h3><p style="font-family:Helvetica"> No. Defi24 is addressed for mid and long term cryptocurrency holders.This is not an app for high frequency traders.The only type of operations covered by defi24 are purchases. If a user sells an asset which was bought in the past, the user might want to delete the past operation, as the benefit/loss derived from the sale is currently fiat and not part of the current crypto portfolio.<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica">What is the price of the assets in the watchlist based on?</h3><p style="font-family:Helvetica"> Assets price is defined based on the local currency selected by the user.<h3 style="font-family:Helvetica">Where do we export files?</h3><p style="font-family:Helvetica"> On iPhone devices and Android 11 devices, files are exported to the \'Documents\' folder inside the Defi24 directory. On Android 10 devices it will be exported to the \'Download\' folder.
